# Gun-Game
Gun Game plugin for TShock. Comes with a config for weapon list, spawn positions and kills required.

If you don't know what "Gun Game" is, it's based off a mode from CoD where all players start with the same weapon, usually something weak. Once they get a kill, their weapon gets upgraded.

The plugin requires server side characters to prevent cheating. It also wipes your inventory, armor, accessories and ammo to switch weapons so, like, keep that in mind.
