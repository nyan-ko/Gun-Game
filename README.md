# Gun-Game
Gun Game plugin for TShock. Comes with a config for weapon list, spawn positions and kills required.

If you don't know what "Gun Game" is, it's based off a mode from CoD where all players start with a weak weapon. Once they get a kill, they are then able to upgrade their weapon.

The plugin requires server side characters to prevent cheating. It also wipes your inventory (other things like armor and accessories are left alone) to switch switch weapons so, like, keep that in mind.
